      This simple lasagna recipe is hearty, cheesy, and perfect for family
      dinners or meal prep. It uses layers of rich meat sauce, creamy ricotta,
      gooey mozzarella and tender lasagna noodles for a comforting dish that's
      easy to assemble and even better the next day.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the meat sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef (or half beef, half Italian sausage)</li>
      <li>1 (24 oz) jar marinara or pasta sauce</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the cheese layer:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15 oz) container ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley or Italian seasoning (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Other:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>9 lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>Extra grated Parmesan for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</strong>
        This gives your oven time to heat up while you prep everything else.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the meat sauce.</strong>
        In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped
        onion and cook until soft (about 5 minutes). Stir in garlic and cook 1
        minute. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Drain excess fat if
        needed. Stir in the marinara sauce and season with salt, pepper, and
        Italian seasoning. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Boil the noodles (if using regular).</strong>
        Cook lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and
        lay flat on parchment or a towel to keep them from sticking. Skip this
        step if using no-boil noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mix the ricotta layer.</strong>
        In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan, a pinch of salt,
        pepper, and parsley. Mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Assemble the lasagna.</strong>
        In a 9x13" baking dish:
        <ul>
          <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
          <li>Layer 3 noodles over it.</li>
          <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture.</li>
          <li>Add a layer of meat sauce.</li>
          <li>Sprinkle a handful of mozzarella.</li>
          <li>
            Repeat two more times: noodles → ricotta → meat sauce → mozzarella.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish with a final layer of noodles, sauce, and a generous layer of
            mozzarella and Parmesan on top.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake.</strong>
        Cover with foil (to prevent cheese from burning) and bake for 25
        minutes. Remove foil and bake another 15–20 minutes, or until cheese is
        bubbly and lightly golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Let it rest.</strong>
        Remove from oven and let the lasagna sit for 10–15 minutes before
        slicing. This helps it set and hold its shape.
      </li>
    </ol>
