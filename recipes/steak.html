      sear. Ideal for beginners or experienced cooks alike, it's a reliable

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the steak:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 boneless ribeye or New York strip steak (about 1-inch thick)</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (or other high-smoke-point oil)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
      <li>2-3 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Let the steak come to room temperature.</strong>
        Remove the steak from the fridge about 30-60 minutes before cooking.
        This helps it cook more evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season generously.</strong>
        Pat the steak dry with paper towels. Season both sides liberally with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the skillet.</strong>
        Place a cast iron skillet over high heat. Let it heat up for about 5
        minutes, until it's very hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sear the steak.</strong>
        Add oil to the pan, then place the steak in the skillet. Let it cook
        undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until a golden crust forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flip and sear the other side.</strong>
        Turn the steak and sear the second side for another 2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baste with butter and aromatics.</strong>
        Add butter, smashed garlic, and herbs to the skillet. Tilt the pan
        slightly and use a spoon to baste the melted butter over the steak
        repeatedly for 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Check for doneness.</strong>
        Use a meat thermometer to check internal temp: 125째F for rare, 135째F for
        medium-rare, 145째F for medium. Remove from heat when it's 5째F below your
        target, as it will continue cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Let it rest.</strong>
        Transfer steak to a plate and let it rest uncovered for 5-10 minutes.
        This helps the juices redistribute for maximum tenderness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Slice and serve.</strong>
        Slice against the grain and serve immediately. Optionally, top with a
        bit of finishing salt or serve with your favorite sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
