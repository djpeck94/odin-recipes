    <p>
      This classic garlic bread is buttery, crisp on the outside, and soft on
      the inside. It’s the perfect side dish for pasta, soup, or any hearty
      meal. Using fresh garlic and good bread makes all the difference for
      flavor that’s bold but balanced.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the garlic butter:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>3–4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (or 1 tablespoon dried)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the bread:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 loaf French bread or Italian bread, cut in half lengthwise</li>
      <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
      <li>Shredded mozzarella for a cheesy version (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</strong>
        This ensures the garlic butter melts evenly into the bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the garlic butter.</strong>
        In a small bowl, mix together softened butter, minced garlic, parsley,
        salt, and pepper until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spread the butter mixture.</strong>
        Evenly spread the garlic butter over the cut sides of the bread. Make
        sure to go all the way to the edges for full flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Optional: add cheese.</strong>
        If desired, sprinkle Parmesan or shredded mozzarella over the buttered
        bread for an extra cheesy finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the bread.</strong>
        Place the bread halves on a baking sheet, cut side up. Bake for 10–12
        minutes until the edges start to turn golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Optional: broil for a crisp top.</strong>
        Turn the oven to broil and broil the bread for 1–2 minutes for a
        crispier, lightly browned top. Watch closely to avoid burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Slice and serve.</strong>
        Remove from oven, let cool slightly, then slice into pieces and serve
        warm.
      </li>
    </ol>
